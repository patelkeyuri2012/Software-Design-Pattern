- Write a program in java where user want to connect his/her application with either MySql or Oracle or PostgreSql or any other database using factory method with structure, class diagram, participant and mapping, consequence, collabration


Participant and Mapping:

Database
participant: Interface defining database operations.
mapping: Connects to MySQLDatabase, OracleDatabase, PostgreSQLDatabase.

MySQLDatabase
participant: Concrete implementation for MySQL database.
mapping: Implements Database.

OracleDatabase
participant: Concrete implementation for Oracle database.
mapping: Implements Database.

PostgreSQLDatabase
participant: Concrete implementation for PostgreSQL database.
mapping: Implements Database.

DatabaseFactory
participant: Factory class for creating database instances.
mapping: Returns instances of MySQLDatabase, OracleDatabase, PostgreSQLDatabase.

Main
participant: Client class.
mapping: Requests database instances from DatabaseFactory.


Consequences:

Advantages:
Loose Coupling: Promotes loose coupling between client code and concrete implementations.
Scalability: Easy addition of new database types.
Flexibility: Allows for flexible object creation.

Disadvantages:
Complexity: Can introduce complexity in the codebase if overused or misapplied.



Collaboration:

Interface: Database
Collaboration: Defines the contract for database operations. Concrete classes (MySQLDatabase, OracleDatabase, PostgreSQLDatabase) implement this interface.

Factory Class: DatabaseFactory
Collaboration: Responsible for creating instances of concrete database classes (MySQLDatabase, OracleDatabase, PostgreSQLDatabase) based on client requests.

Concrete Class: MySQLDatabase, OracleDatabase, PostgreSQLDatabase
Collaboration: Implements the Database interface. These concrete classes provide specific implementations for database operations.
